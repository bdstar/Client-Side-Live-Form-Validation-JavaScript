# Client-Side Live Form Validation using JavaScript

When we are working with the input Form then it is more important for validation of all of the data. There are two types of validation are existing is that Server-Side Validation and Client-Side Validation. Client-side validation is often much faster and provides the user with a very good experience. Validating form data from the client-side is easy to do and can save a lot of unnecessary calls to the server as all processing is handled by the web browser. JavaScript provides a way to validate form data on the client's computer before sending it to the webserver.
Recently I have done an interactive client-side form validation using JavaScript that’s I want to share with this Codeproject community. So let’s get started,


## Installation

Clone the project from the Github repository and run your Webserver. Open the project the to web browser.

## Conclusion
Actually, it is most important for any input form to validation the data that users are inputting. Client-side form validations help in giving immediate feedback to the user but it is also required to add server-side form validation form to the processing script. The user can disable JavaScript on their server or even auto-bots might try to submit your form as well. But as the client side validation can be given immediate feedback to the user so that it should be used for the form processing. I hope you will enjoy this above project to validate the data for the client-side form validation. Happy Coding to you…..:)
